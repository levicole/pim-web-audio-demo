      This is a demo of 1bit polyphony using Pulse Interleaving Modulation. This is a conversion of the demo provided by <a href="http://protodome.com">Blake Troise (aka PROTODOME)</a> in his article "<a href="https://online.ucpress.edu/jsmg/article/1/1/44/2337/The-1-Bit-InstrumentThe-Fundamentals-of-1-Bit">The 1-Bit Instrument: The Fundamentals of 1-Bit Synthesis, Their Implementational Implications, and Instrumental Possibilities</a>"

      The sound is a bit crackly, and I'm not sure if that's due to my implementation or JS not being able to keep up.
